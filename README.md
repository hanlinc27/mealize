# ðŸ¥™ mealize

This Android application uses Python scraping from current Flipp flyers in order to determine what items are on sale. It then generates some relevant recipes for the user based on current items in the refrigerator as well as discounted products. 

The flow: 
*detects nearby grocery stores
*scrapes Flipp for the items that are on sale at said grocery store
*asks for dietary restrictions
*uses a live camera stream which recognizes a picture you take (of a food item currently in your fridge) and deploys a machine *learning model to classify it
*generates recipes from existing and items on sale!
